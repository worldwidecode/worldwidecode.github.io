## Less accountability, more responsibility

Words often take on *lives of their own* over time.

It's widely acknowledged that words can carry significantly different interpretations for different individuals. An example from politics illustrates this perfectly—words like *"woke"* and *"traditional"* have been **distorted from their original meanings.**

In the realm of workplace language, a term that has undergone such transformation is *"accountable".*

Instead of conveying its intended definition, which should be closer to "you need to take charge of both the problem and the solution," it has now become synonymous with **"if things go wrong, *you're the one to blame*."**

`Granting full accountability to individuals is a feat, but it remains essential within any organization or project.`

**Establishing a clear point of contact for discussing a project is vital for enhancing communication and teamwork.** Assuming leadership roles on projects can also be rewarding.

However, ***the word "accountability" no longer quite encapsulates the concept.*** Part of the reason might be its widespread use *across various contexts.*

**Precision in language is of utmost importance.** As language constitutes the primary tool for communication, and with workplace communication increasingly occurring through digital and textual means, we're losing some of our natural ability to decipher others' emotional states through body language.

Hence, it's crucial to deliberate over your words more **thoughtfully**. This doesn't imply sugarcoating or excessive sensitivity, but rather ensuring that *your chosen words align with your anticipated outcomes.*

`What precise meaning are you attempting to convey to someone?`

Consider "accountability" and some of my suggestions for more accurately conveying your intentions.

Take a moment to reflect on each term:

- **You're in charge —>** you'll dictate to others what to do
- **You're taking the lead —>** others will follow your guidance and example
- **You're taking attribution —>** you're claiming credit for the final outcome (both good and bad)
- **You're responsible for quality control —>** you ensure the project meets standards
- **You're responsible —>** the project's outcome hinges on you
- **You're accountable —>** if things go sour, you'll have to answer
- **This is your project —>** you decide what to do with the idea
- **You have ownership —>** admittedly, I dislike this one too, as it implies a false sense of possession

The nuances and energy behind each term differ significantly. ***So why do we often employ them so interchangeably?***

By conveying ***precise*** expectations, we enhance our working relationships.
