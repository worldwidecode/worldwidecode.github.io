## You’re facing a problem right now - ask why

A simple tip I received from a family member, who is a coach, is to ask `"why?"` *five* times.

`"Why?"` *you might ask.*

To get to the **root** of a problem.

`"Why?"` *you ask again.*

To **truly understand** what's happening.

`"Why?"` *you repeat once more.*

So we can **address the problem.**

`"Why?"` *you almost infuriate me.*

To achieve **a better outcome** than the current problem.

`"Why?"` *- at this point, steam is coming out of my head.*

Because **I want to improve** if I can!

***It's not just the final answer*** that provides a response to your question; ***it's each of the above.***

`An unanswered question you have is also just a problem.`

The saying that it's “*about the journey, not the destination”* holds **true** here.

From the above example, you can develop an *action plan,* consider things you need to *think more about,* *identify flaws* in your initial assumptions, **and much more.**

`You could shuffle any of the answers around, and the responses and order would still make plenty of sense.`

**When we confront challenging our own thoughts, rather than seeking a one-dimensional answer externally, we open ourselves up to a frontier of possibilities.**

We should strive to keep our minds engaged across *as many aspects of a problem as possible* before zoning in.

If we imagine our problem as a metal cube sitting on a table, and someone says, "solve this problem," **what would we *do?***

Depending on our experience, we might initially determine if it's a Rubik's Cube. But even if it is, that's not enough. We'd need to ensure it has an equal number of colors on each side **and** the ability to rotate.

We might spend all that time solving the actual Rubik's Cube, only to reach a moment where we say, *"Ta-da! Done!"*—and then the person says, "The problem was to see if you could ***understand*** that this was a Rubik's Cube."

The point of the above example and the `"why"` question is that **we need as much information as possible about our problems**.

We also need an equal amount of information about ***our reasoning*** for wanting to address something ***as a problem.***

`Examining the individual layers between the deductive questions exposes our thought process to more surface area.`

**It can help us comprehend our reasoning, constraints, and limitations.**

By having a broader surface area to contemplate a problem, rather than an extremely one-dimensional problem statement or question, **we enhance our potential to use creative thinking in connecting different parts of our brains and memory** (neuron connections) to generate *more* novel ideas, solutions, and thoughts.

`Questioning yourself and others is as much about reaching an answer as realizing that there might not be a straightforward one.`

The next time you encounter a problem repeatedly ask yourself `"why"`.

***You'll become accustomed to shifting from problem identification mode to problem-solving mode,** which gradually becomes simpler over time.*

This is also exceptionally useful when you feel *paralyzed* to take action.

`Ask yourself why you read this article. 5 times, to start.`
