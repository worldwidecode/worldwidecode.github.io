## Turn “I don’t know” into your strongest tool

No one in your company or team should be made to feel *afraid or inferior* because they don’t know the answer to a question. 

Instead, **both you and they** should be **inquisitive** about ***why* they don’t know something.**

`Listing all the reasons someone might not know something would be exhausting.`

Rather, let’s take a flip-side perspective on ***the other party in the conversation.***

`Why does the other person expect that person to know something?`

This is often an **unleveraged question,** and one from which we can learn *a lot.*

Now, consider what domain of knowledge the other person had in mind for you and why you weren’t **able** to match up to that *expectation.* 

`It could be a misunderstanding of the *other* person's assumption that something falls within your domain of knowledge.`

While it would be too easy to chalk it down to an error being made, it’s more productive to dive one layer deeper into the reasoning for this.

**An “I don’t know” response often indicates that there is a bridge or connection between pieces of information that is missing.**

Equally, it can show that the question asked was not the pertinent one *for that moment.*

When someone comes to me for marketing advice, I sometimes feel obliged to answer “I don’t know” to questions because **it’s the correct *and honest thing to do.*** 

It is not a direct reflection of my skill or competence in the area they are asking about.

If I get asked about **how to improve their branding,** but I don’t have the specifics of what they have been doing in the past, I **can’t** know without more background.

`Consider responding "I can't know, yet" rather than "I don't know."`

My lack of knowledge on how to respond to a question means that I am not able to connect the dots in my mind.

`"I don't know" is not the same as a lack of response. It is a response, like any other.`

If we’re playing a game of cards, and you ask me what cards I think you have, even with the best strategy, play, and experience, there will be situations where *I don’t know.*

If we’re playing a game of chess, and you ask me what move I think you’ll make, the same situation can occur if there are multiple moves present, or I simply do not spot one.

**Admitting that “I don’t know” is neither positive nor negative, but rather just a response, turns it into a tool.**

Tools are just *tools.*

If I asked you if an SQL database was positive or negative, how would you answer? Simply, you should answer, “It’s an SQL database. It doesn’t **have** an intrinsic positive or negative value. Depending on how it’s used, *it can be positive, negative, or even neutral.”* 

But if I told you you have to solve a problem that requires some sort of data storage, you’d want the *option* of a SQL database.

**Having options is usually positive.**

*Unless it leads to action paralysis.*

Go into any carpenter’s workshop and you will find a mountain of wrenches and screwdrivers. 

Some are old and hidden in drawers.

**You should consider putting "I don't know" right up there on your workbench,** together with the other tools that you use the most, **and tell anyone that *they can use it.***

`"I don't know" doesn't signify the end of a conversation. Rather, it begins one.`

The next time someone asks you something and you don’t know, consider the **compliment** that firstly they think you would be able to answer that question.

And if they’re asking you a question they *know you don’t know,* I hope it’s approached as a *Socratic dialogue*. 

Otherwise, they might be purposefully poking at you. ***No one likes that.***

***Don’t do that.***
