## Your website talks too much

Your website talks too much.

The number one piece of advice I give to almost any company seeking help with website conversion rates is to cut down on text. And I mean at the rate of the Amazon logging.

You should have a lot of text on your homepage **only** in the following situations:

1. Your competitors have established a dominant marketing strategy, and being too brief might undermine your *legitimacy*.
2. Your target customer isn't expecting an immediate Call to Action (CTA) and has come to your website purely to gather information.
3. Your audience consists of patient, diligent readers *(essentially, you're selling to gnomes).*
4. You lack the resources to create subpages, and for some reason, you must rely on a one-page landing page style homepage.
5. Your product is exceedingly complex, and you **must** list all its characteristics and assets, praying and hoping someone will *please take the time to read everything.*

Consider this: 

`Our entire digital experience revolves around text. Everywhere we go online, we're constantly reading.`

`As a result, we naturally develop reading strategies that minimize effort and maximize reward.`

This often means *quickly switching to another website if we don't find what we need,* **immediately**. Large blocks of text are instinctively off-putting.

When someone lands on your website, assume they already have some background context. If not, how *did* they land there?

**Focus immediately on your product-market fit:** you have the product, and they are the market.

If you can't convey that within the first five seconds, you've already lost them. Statistics show that up to 50% of people will have already left.

The most critical action you can take within those first five seconds, i.e., during the initial *view and scroll*, is to **do everything you can to entice them not to close your website**.

**`Do everything you can to entice them not to close your website.`**

This is so important that I had to capitalize and repeat it.

Whether it's through humor or something sexy, you ****must**** stand out.

`The more general your product is, the less time you have (usually correlated to market size).`

Hence, it is imperative to find ways to *convey your **offering** to your website visitor.*

A common mistake people make here is taking their company niche too literally. Instead, use my definition:

`What I do = what I offer + why customers choose me`

For example:

`Costy is a CRM 
—> Costy is a CRM for the lowest price in the market 
—> Costy is a CRM with the same features as SalesForce but 5x cheaper`

If someone lands on the website of the imaginary Costy CRM, *they were already interested*. 

For the majority of your market, you don't need to explain what a CRM is, how it works, and what its basic features are. **People already know.**

And for those who have no knowledge or education on the offering, ***they will instinctively take more time to read.*** 

If this constitutes a significant portion of your customer base, consider creating a subpage like "New to CRMs?".

`Everything on your website should be precise and purposeful.`

So **start cutting all that text that no one ever reads.** As someone who has worked on many websites over the years, I implore you to do an exercise:

`Go Google a tool you're interested in but don't intend to buy today and explore the different company websites.`

Now see how much of their homepage and website you've actually read before making up 80% of your decision on whether this is a company you like and trust.

Again:

`Your customer wants to know what you do, what you offer, and how much it costs. That's it.`
