## Build things progressively

Whenever I work on a new project, whether for myself or with someone else, one of my favorite moments is always ***the blank canvas.***

A blank canvas allows for unfiltered inspiration right from the beginning: endless possibilities in ***what* to do**, and more interestingly, ***how to do it.***

`The “how” question is key.`

Many people prefer not to take the initiative of starting with a blank canvas because of action paralysis: uncertainty in whatever the process ***may*** be. *Note: a process they are fearful of, but have not even started.*

**Everyone has their unique way of working, and tapping into that is key.**

`Doing what comes naturally to you will deliver not just an end result that is yours, but also a working process that you will enjoy without feeling stressed and cumbersome.`

**Build: start with a block, an idea, a tool, and to just keep moving forward by adding *one more block at a time.***

Adding these blocks together, **first** define the scope of the project.

When doing or building something, ask and answer high-level questions like:

1. What does it do?
2. Why should it do that?
3. What does it not do?
4. And why should it not do that?

**Knowing what is a "go" and a "no-go" offers the clarity to keep building ideas on top of each other, *in an order that comes naturally to whatever the idea is * **at the time** *(intuition).*

`Figure out what makes increasingly more sense along the way: just stick to the truths you already know.`

For example, for a digital education platform, you could answer questions like:

1. **What it does:** It educates people on the dangers of drunk driving.
2. **It does this:** Because it cares about people's safety. It also wants to promote the city council of Melbourne.
3. **What it doesn’t:** It doesn't act in an aggressive way. Furthermore, it also does not discourage general alcohol use: only when driving.
4. **It doesn’t do this:** Because we don't want to discourage people from a true, honest, caring, human message.

Answering these few simple questions offers guidelines.

`Focus on questions that are guide rails, like on a road.`

Pieces of content, images, questions and answers, etc., that fit within these guide rails **can always be worked on, *and iteratively experimented with to grow into bigger ideas.***

Creating this foundation for yourself and answering simple high-level questions gives you **a starting point.**

After that, the other questions will *naturally work themselves out the more refined you go,* **but only intuitively and organically if you keep progressively asking them, almost linearly, according to their relative niche-value** to the specific topic you're handling at the time.

`Build progressively: start high-level and continue moving. In whatever directions, but between the guide rails.`
