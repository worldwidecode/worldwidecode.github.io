## Good branding makes proud employees

One of the most underestimated perks for employees working at a company is the company's **branding**.

`The effort invested in the company's branding portrays a lot about the care and diligence put into the business.`

The majority of companies nowadays have to rely on their **digital presence** for their entire branding.

When someone shares where they work with others, the first thing that other person will always do is ***look at the company website and/or company LinkedIn.***

If the website looks disorganized and sloppy, it reflects poorly on outsiders' ***perception*** of the working culture.

**Most people will lack insight into your company's true nature and operations**, aside from the image and branding you present.

You could have an amazing collaborative environment and customers, *but without offering a **flavorful** taste of your activities, they won't understand.*

By creating comprehensive branding, **you are greatly benefiting your employees.**

One of the primary factors in attracting talent is their question:
`"How will this appear on my resume?"`
**This is unavoidable.**

I have experience with companies possessing minimal web presence and those with extensive web presence. 

Generally, this doesn't necessarily reflect how good *they* are. It simply reflects on how good they are at **branding**.

`Whatever you depict on your website should be how you wish others to perceive you.`

It shouldn't and *must not* be a falsehood.

But, naturally, you want to showcase your best side.

`Would you upload an unattractive picture on Tinder?`

However, **you also shouldn't present yourself as *someone you're not.*** That's a *quick* way to get ghosted after one date.

`Ali is a recent graduate at a creative agency, but their website appears unchanged for the last years. They know they'll need to exert extra effort to convince their next employer that they've been involved in cutting-edge projects.`

The most significant advice I offer companies regarding branding isn't about *specific* *traits.*

***`It's that your company should exude a modern appearance.`***

There's no reason for your company to have an outdated look *for your industry.*

**Most employees joining startups or SMEs seek a reputation for being at the forefront of innovation.**

Ensure your employees feel proud to be well-represented somewhere.

`Your website serves as your storefront.`

And it's your employees' ticket, their business card to their network.
