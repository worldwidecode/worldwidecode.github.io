## Consistent quality work is possible

*You can only skip steps on a staircase as long as your legs are.*

*You can only jump steps on a staircase as strong as your legs are.*

*You can trip and fall down a staircase no matter how long or strong your legs are.*

When working, it's natural to aim for the ***quickest*** path to your desired destination.

This tendency is often praised as a hallmark of a great employee:

`"John already turned in his report this morning!”`

Some work thrives on speed, while other excels through care and patience. However, neither of these approaches directly implies ***quality.***

**The quality of your work output is *measured* by you and your company, regardless of the industry.**

However, this doesn't mean you possess the ultimate ***judgement*** of final quality.

The customer is the arbiter of that.

`You must decide which processes in your company require speed, and which demand patience.`

Merely stating that your company prioritizes one over the other is ***insufficient*** and a lazy generalization.

Perhaps you want communication to prioritize speed, ***except*** when it concerns intra-company presentations.

`The simplest approach is to simplify or codify the process and incorporate it into a company knowledge base.`

This practice should become ingrained in the working culture, ***evolving over time into something intuitive*** that new team members readily adopt.

**What you mustn't do, however, is attempt to shortcut your way to quality.**

This underscores the importance of **defining what quality means *to you.***

**`Quality `** `is a noun that gauges things relative to a standard, and you have the power to set that standard.`

It has a distinct definition apart from the adjective of “quality”**.**

*If I asked you to deliver a **quantity of work,** you'd inquire, "How much?"*

*Similarly, if I asked you to deliver a **quality of work,** you should also inquire, "How much?"*

`One common mistake companies make is not having a yardstick for quality.`

Consequently, the quality of work output is often seen as a ***subjective function tied to the individual.***

**However, this is just part of the equation.**

In the military, for instance, ***everyone*** must be capable of doing 35 pushups.

Yet, soldiers evaluate each other in relation to the group average.

Those who fall below the group average ***sense*** the pressure to catch up.

**Unless pushups are a company-wide practice, establishing a measuring standard can be challenging, except for specific, measurable roles like sales.**

`Yet, because of this, it's even more crucial to set standards for activities involving all team members.`

Set benchmarks for common areas such as **messaging, presentations, knowledge sharing, and timelines.**

Every person in your company wishes to gauge ***how well they're performing.***

`Your team members greatest fear is being judged by an invisible standard they can't comprehend.`

Your customers are on the second floor.

Make it as clear as possible how your employees ***ought*** to go up the staircase.
