## Don’t tell your customers what they need

There is a fine line in coming across authoritatively on a topic to your customers and letting them figure out the answer themselves.

`People like to figure out things.`

**Intuitively, most people will trust their *own* answers more than *others*.**

*Even* if they didn’t get to the answer *all by themselves.*

It's like when you’re with a child, and you teach them about 2 + 2. When you lift that final finger up, they’re going to scream `"4"!`

**We should imagine our relationship in educating them as a teacher and student.**

If your blog posts, seminars, and other educational channels are too sales-y, you’re going to create ***suspicion in how they see you.***

`Once you have aroused suspicion in someone, it’s very hard to undo.`

**It is infinitely easier to build trust with someone you have a clean rapport with.**

If you consider the level of trust with someone on a scale from `-1 to 1`, where `-1` represents complete lack of trust and `1` signifies total trust, any value in the negative range is **working exponentially against you.**

Progressing from `-0.2` to `1` can require ***twice the effort*** compared to moving from **`0`** to **`1`**.

`It’s very important that you do not unknowingly risk tarnishing elements in your customer journey.`

If your sales rely on a very custom, face-to-face driven process, the marketer who automatically sends off a cheap-looking discount email is going to arouse that *suspicion.*

**It is up to you to decide *where* you’re going to make bets in priming your customers’ minds to buy whatever you’re selling.**

There is no correct formula for how this is done.

Rather, we can learn from ***how poker players play.***

Depending on the strength of their cards, their position, and the cards they believe the other players have, they decide ***how big of a bet*** to make as each card comes down.

**Every time you tell your customers something, you're making a *bet* that it will resonate with them.**

If you make the wrong bet, they might just get up and **leave.**

Poker is ***not*** a good analogy for your business because it is a zero-sum game.

**You should be playing win-win games with your customer.**

`But poker is a `*`great `* `analogy for your marketing and sales process.`

*Almost* always, we **have** to play this game with the customer.

***Do they know what is good for me? Or are they just doing what is good for themselves?***

This is the **eternal** question they’re going to keep on asking.

**So let them come to their own conclusions as much as possible.**

One of the ways to do this is to be ***simple-informative.***

`Simple, and informative.`

If you convolute your message with complicated technicalities and terrible corporate speak, they’re not going to grasp ***the essence*** of what you’re selling.

If you can't market ***the essence***, you can't sell ***the value***.

If you can explain your business to your customer face-to-face without them needing to ask questions, you can do it in your marketing strategy too.

You wouldn’t try to be weird and sneaky around people you know in real life, *right?*

**Don’t let that be your digital presence either.**
