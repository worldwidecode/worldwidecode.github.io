## Be organic, not plastic

If your friend told you, ***"that person is fake,"*** how would your attitude be toward that person?

Most likely, you wouldn't have a favorable impression of them.

The same principle applies to your company's brand.

`You don't want anyone to perceive your brand as inauthentic.`

But truthfully, very few companies are ***fake.***

***Fake*** implies pretending to be something they are not, and such companies are quickly exposed by *the market.*

However, there's another term that's closely related yet doesn't *quite* carry the same meaning.

`Plastic.`

If that same friend told you, ***"that person is plastic,"*** would your reaction be exactly the same?

The connotations of these two words are **inherently** different.

***Plastic*** possesses a quality similar to an object, and it conveys a sense of *artificiality.*

`Something that is plastic doesn't necessarily mean it's fake.`

Instead, it signifies something that has been artificially created, not stemming from a *natural* source.

I don't encounter many fake companies in my surroundings, likely because I don't associate with such circles. However, they certainly exist, often promoted by *influencers.* ðŸ¤¢

In my capacity as an entrepreneur and marketer, I do come across numerous companies that could be described as ***plastic.***

`A plastic company lacks character.`

**It fails to express its identity or the personalities of its employees.**

It might as well display one sentence on its homepage: *"We sell custom business service sales jargon product problem-solutions."*

**A plastic company isn't necessarily a poor one.**

Instead, it is a *forgettable* one.

It is a *replaceable* one.

If you enjoy McDonaldâ€™s, do you have a preferred McDonaldâ€™s store to order from, or do you just choose the one that's ***closest?***

**Building an organic brand requires your company to be seen as human.**

This doesn't diminish your brand's professionalism *at all.*

Rather, it implies moving away from excessive stock images on your website and instead featuring photographs of your team members.

It signifies acknowledging that ***business with you* is more than just a company.**

Business with you is part of human culture. Do **not** allow a digital environment to erase this.

`Be a merchant in Cairo, Egypt, 2000 BC.`

***If you could convey anything about your company to your customers, what would it be?***

Perhaps it's your genuine commitment to **teamwork.** Maybe it's something about the color ***purple.***

`Maybe itâ€™s the story of how you got to where you are.`

Take that concept and illuminate it within your branding.

***People prefer purchasing from other people.***

Vending machines are only for quick, simple, and *plastic* products.
