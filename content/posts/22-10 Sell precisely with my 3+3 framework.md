## Sell precisely with the 3+3 framework

When broken down to fundamentals, **your customers will have many of the same and similar questions.**

`It's a good practice to sit down with your team and compile a list of all the questions you can think of that customers might have.`

By doing so, you can then **prioritize** the areas in which you need to be thoroughly prepared, rehearsed, **and** inquisitive.

**If you can address your customer's questions before they even ask them, you'll establish an immediate foundation of trust.** 

You'll also add a touch of *synchronicity.*

There are three core questions that your customers will **always** have:

1. What is your solution for my problem?
2. How much does it cost?
3. How **quickly** can I benefit from it?

The third question is often underestimated, yet for many companies, it holds significant importance.

**The speed at which someone *benefits* from your offering is not synonymous with how swiftly you can *deliver* your product or service.**

Rather, it's part of their *ROI calculation.*

Understanding that both you and your customers are **constantly engaged** in this ROI assessment will shift your perspective on ROI in marketing and sales.

Here’s my formula:

`Our ROI > value created > their ROI`

**Realize that your company isn't Dunder Mifflin: one of *only two* paper suppliers in Scranton, PA.**

If customers believe your solution is promising but the benefits will take too long to materialize, *they **will** seize their momentum and move forward **with someone else.***

Individuals responsible for purchasing decisions in companies often require **buy-in** from managers and colleagues.

After securing the necessary buy-in, **they'll proceed with or without you.**

`Unless you possess a monopoly on a specific product or niche, your company is replaceable.`

This is a ***sobering reality*** that most businesses should come to terms with sooner rather than later.

`You're competing for your customer's attention. But once you've captured it, they're invested in the problem and solution.`

Their investment in the solution is **not your solution.**

**It is any solution.**

`So, what are the other +3 questions in the rule?`

The specific industry you operate in will introduce another 3 primary questions that you'll need to address.

In fact, there will likely be more than 3.

However, remember that we're prioritizing *high-level questions* to construct a **consistent narrative and approach** for tackling *sub-questions*.

`You want your company to operate within a knowledge framework.`

So, if your customer poses the same question to four different representatives, **they'll receive four similar answers.**

People aren't robots, so it's not about delivering rehearsed responses *verbatim.*

It's about agreeing upon the fundamental concepts that ***define your company's reality.***

What do these **additional 3 questions** entail?

For instance, a company offering a SaaS presentation suite might frequently encounter questions like:

1. Why should I use this instead of tools like Canva and Adobe?
2. Is this an advanced tool, or more template-based and quick?
3. What is the learning curve?

If you've addressed these 3 questions, **you’ll build authority with your customer in your niche.**

The reason we opt for the number 3 is that it's a manageable count of questions that most people can think of on the spot, without becoming stuck or overthinking.

`Think of questions you'd want to ask me, the author. How many came to your mind immediately?`

Following the 3+3 framework, we understand that its core isn't necessarily about *numbers*, but rather about ***prioritization*, adhering to fundamental business principles, and formulating fundamental *niche guidelines* for marketing and sales.**

Precision, like that of a skilled dart player, is your aim.

However, even the best dart players can't hit triple-20 every time.

`They simply make sure to always hit the board.`
