## Trust your designer to design

Imagine Steve Jobs going to Vincent van Gogh and not only telling him what to paint but also how to do it.

The frustration that would arise between the two would be *immense*.

The same principle applies to working with designers on your team. I have learned from my own mistakes, being creative but not a professional designer, that **I have often been too attached to my artistic or creative vision** for a website or graphics.

This has led to slow collaboration with an artistic vision that never feels *quite right*.

One of the main goals of your design philosophy for your startup or company should be to have **cohesive, whole branding**. There should be **one consistent line throughout your design**, often achieved when there is nothing more that can be subtracted (in the spirit of minimalism).

When working with a designer, especially when in a position of authority and accountability (managerial or as a project leader), **there is a tendency for everyone to pitch in design ideas**. *The problem arises when creative input from non-designers becomes excessive.*

Most designers choose this profession because they genuinely enjoy the process of creation as an art form. This means that **they need to have ownership over the creation process.**

*They have an **emotional investment** in the design, **you do not.***

Starting the design process, I find that having a conversation and discussion **beforehand** is very helpful. As the one with specifications for the project and the need to deliver it in a certain way, ***give all your technical AND creative input at the VERY beginning.***

`There is no artist who likes others to dictate the direction of a canvas once they have already begun.`

In the spirit of true collaboration, designers should be able to process the *initial specifications* and incorporate them into their work.

Once the design starts taking shape, for example, as the website is being built or the case study is being designed, **stick to just two phrases when it comes to creative comments:**

**`I like that.`**

**`I don't like that.`**

By adhering to this rule, you show respect for the designer's artistic integrity. You don't need to sugarcoat things or beat around the bush.

Instead, **keep your feedback centered on *technical* aspects:**

`We really need our API to be more at the core of this page.`

**`NOT: `**`You should make the API font bigger and bolder and add a panda behind it.`

Doing this will not only result in a happier working relationship, but will also *greatly* improve the quality of the designs.

Rather than imposing something unnatural on a designer, **you are working with their intrinsic talents and skills.**

It might be tempting to throw out your great idea. If you can't resist because you believe it will be game-changing, you can *float* the idea. This means casually mentioning it in an off-hand comment.

Suggesting an idea and asking: ***“Can I get this as a separate asset?”*** is another tactful way of seeing it come to fruition. If it really works in their eyes, as **they are the professionals after all**, they will integrate it.

`Do not push your doodles onto their canvas.`

**The art dealer sells but does not create**. If he cannot sell what an artist creates, *then* he finds another artist.

When it comes to working with designers, it's best to leave *your* hubris at the door. This is not a competition to show how great you can *also* come up with cool ideas.

Your only goal should be to ***push them to do their best.***

Not *your* best.
