## Educate your customers like a school

`"What level of understanding of BOTH the problem and the solution do your customers arrive at your business with?"`

It might seem almost logical to assume that the better they comprehend the problem and solution, the more likely they are to become a *great* customer.

**This assumption is false.**

In fact, logically speaking, the better they understand what the solution should be, the more likely they are to become a **demanding** customer. They will have higher expectations and more specific requirements. ***They will not necessarily make you more money.***

`There exist numerous companies who provide subpar services to uninformed customers.`

**The best solution doesn't always come out on top.**

Considering both these aspects, we can draw a valuable lesson:

`We often do not know how much our customers already know about the problem and solution before we engage with them in conversation.`

We choose to make it our responsibility to uncover this information and gather as much **data** as possible to prepare ourselves.

Consequently, we need to reflect on our customers:

`Can we create the best business relationships with customers who either ` ***`do OR do not know the problem AND/OR solution?`***

**Take a moment to ponder this.**

This implies that there are distinct customer profiles that will approach your business differently, each needing tailored education.

Let's delve into these profiles:

**Knows the problem, does not know the solution:** These are generally great leads since your business can position itself as the best solution for them.

**Does not know the problem, does not know the solution:** These are challenging leads. They require clear guidance on why and how they have a problem. If they don't naturally realize this, pushing too hard could make them believe you're *only interested in making a sale without addressing their actual needs.*

**Knows the problem, knows the solution:** Changing someone's perspective when it's already formed can be a true challenge. If your solution aligns with their beliefs, it's advantageous. However, if not, **expect extensive questioning** unless you can promptly convince them. *Learning from these leads can be immensely valuable. See them as more than just a source of revenue.*

**Does not know the problem, knows the solution:** Generally, you're expending effort in vain unless they're simply misinformed.

***The easiest business comes from when someone is already aware of their problem and is OPEN to a solution.***

`If someone isn't aware of their problem, you must first educate them about it and then, on top of that, convince them `*`your `* `solution is the right one.`

I have seen it many times before: a salesperson spends hours educating a customer about their problem, only for that customer to go to *their competitor.*

`Simultaneously convincing your customer of the problem and solution can sometimes come across as manipulative.`

Recognizing various customer types, the best approach to marketing and sales becomes multifaceted.

First, develop an evolving market analysis that comprehends **the most common problems faced by customers**.

However, this isn't enough!

**You must also comprehend the most common *solutions* customers encounter.** On the market, and *in their heads.*

Revisit the fundamental principle of your business frequently:

`Product-Market fit.`

`Product = solution`

`Market = problem`

**Your business encompasses both the product AND *the fit.***

This is a tricky concept for most people to first wrap their head around, *because no one preaches it.*

However, when it clicks, you will laugh at its simplicity ðŸ™‚

`Your company is a business; it is not the same as your product or service.`

Hence, in educating your customers, structure your content and communication with this perspective:

*`Some customers enroll in 'Gardening I.' Some are ready for 'Gardening II', and others already have a PhD.`*

**When you organize your customer journey based on these principles, you will capture market segments you previously *overlooked.***
