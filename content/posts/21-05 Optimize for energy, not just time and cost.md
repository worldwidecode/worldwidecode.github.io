## Optimize for energy, not just time and cost

In both my work and creative endeavors, I've always been focused on productivity and finding ways to streamline processes. The key is to eliminate unnecessary steps and **focus on the core aspects that create real value**.

As a musician, I've found that having ready-to-go templates in my Digital Audio Workstation saves me valuable time and effort. Instead of constantly adjusting settings, I can now start working on my music within minutes.

The same principle applies to business, and it's remarkable how effective it can be to codify processes by simply writing them down.

Over time, I've discovered two valid approaches to enhance productivity:

1. **Workable Productivity Solution:** Invest time upfront to create an efficient system that saves time in the long run (delayed gratification).
2. **Bulk Work Approach:** Allocate specific time periods to tackle tasks in bulk, building momentum (instant gratification).

Depending on the situation, either approach can be valuable. While my inventor nature is naturally drawn to the first method, I've learned that sometimes the second approach is more realistic in terms of time and cost.

However, it's crucial to recognize that time and cost are not the only factors affecting productivity. **There's a third aspect that deserves our attention: energy â€“ both physical and soulful energy.**

Performing manual and repetitive tasks, like copy-pasting data between different sources, is incredibly draining. It's far from being fun and enjoyable; it saps our motivation and enthusiasm.

While people often say that time is the most valuable asset, **what good is time without the energy to make the most of it?** If we're tired, lethargic, and uninspired, we won't be able to utilize our time effectively.

`Energy is even more critical than time in determining our productivity.`

One of the most frustrating forms of energy wastage is mindless, repetitive work that still demands our focus and attention. Pair that with sitting behind a screen all day, disconnected from the real world, and it becomes genuinely painful.

To maintain high morale within a company, it's vital to structure processes around energy considerations.

`Treating employees as automatons may work in the short term, but it won't retain the top talent that strives to challenge their mind.`

Numerous startups make the mistake of failing to address this issue when trying to attract young, ambitious professionals. They promise exciting opportunities in cutting-edge industries, but reality sets in when those opportunities turn into monotonous and unfulfilling tasks.

So, how can we optimize for energy and enhance productivity?

1. **Embrace Software Automation:** Implement automation wherever possible to reduce the burden on employees. What is seen as a few clicks to management may translate to thousands of clicks for employees, adding up over time. It is important to note that *a click often still requires a conscious, mental decision.*
2. **Streamline Tedious Processes:** Codify repetitive tasks to the tee to ensure that employees can invest their physical efforts while preserving their mental energy. Furthermore, this eliminates doubts for employees about whether they're doing the correct thing, reducing uncertainty and, in turn, anxiety.

When allocating resources and planning strategies, **always take energy into account**. Ignoring this might lead to negative consequences, such as high employee turnover due to burnout and dissatisfaction.

By valuing and preserving the energy of our team members, we can create a more fulfilling and sustainable work environment for everyone involved. And who wouldn't see that as the most significant asset of all?
