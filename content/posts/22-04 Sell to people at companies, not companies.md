## Sell to people at companies, not companies

When selling B2B, you're also selling to a C: ***the person(s) with whom you have contact with*** (especially the first).

Many marketers seem to treat the marketing process as if they're selling to someone who acts as ***a perfect representative of the company.***

`Most people do not act as representatives of the company; they act as `*`their role `* `at `*`their company.`*

Unless you're targeting very specific *corporate personas,* like buyers, the people you are marketing are engaged in work *beyond solely seeking things to buy.*

**It's important to understand that you're marketing to a person AND negotiating with both a person and a business.**

Most people will not make a purchase decision based solely on whether it is good for their company. *They want to know if it's also beneficial for **them.***

`Someone wouldn't purchase a robot that replaces their job at their company.`

Some of the benefits that ***the customer of the business you're selling to*** gains by making a good purchase decision include:

- It reflects positively on their competences and initiative.
- It helps with their job stability.
- It gives them more buy-in and a stronger influence on future purchase decisions.
- It could increase their future budget and departmental size if they perform well.
- It equips them with the necessary skills of purchasing and potentially negotiation, which can be leveraged both within and outside the company, even in the job market.
- It expands their knowledge.
- It gives them a sense of accomplishment.
- *It's one less hour spent looking at those **dreadful** spreadsheets.*

By truly recognizing that, in the end, you're still selling to and dealing with people, you can adjust your marketing and sales process to **systematically target your funnel:**

1. Capture their **personal attention**.
2. Appeal to their **personal ambitions**.
3. Highlight how their business can ***fund their ambitions,*** while also benefiting the business.
4. Emphasize the advantages for their business to gain **buy-in from fellow team members.**
5. Maintain this person as your **champion** if they have enough buy-in, or express gratitude and navigate to the **relevant authority** while attributing credit to them.
6. **Conduct negotiations with the business *on a B2B level.***

Following this strategy creates a *win-win situation,* encouraging individuals to prioritize engaging with your business above all other obligations.

`Appeal to people's self-interest; you can't go wrong.`
