## Create beloved features with two-sided value

*Spotify shuffle isn’t random.*

If you've never thought or heard about this before, you're part of the 99%, ***and*** you might be confused for a moment.

Spotify will mix up songs **and** still play them *in an order,* similarly to how a DJ would create a set.

When a listener clicks the shuffle button, they have two **thoughts** that go through their head:

1. I want to listen to random songs.
2. I don't want to play my playlist in its chronological order.

`Spotify has understood incredibly well that the customer is not saying, `*`“I want to listen to random songs according to the fundamental laws of mathematics.”*`

Simply, they are saying, *"I want you to mix up my songs and play them in a **new** order."*

This is taking something beyond a simple feature, and turning it into **huge value.**

*In my opinion, it’s one of the **best** examples of consumer insight.*

Spotify, in turn, is able to benefit from this *pseudo-randomness* by **algorithmically setting it up to maximize profits,** and other metrics it finds important.

`Customers have intentions, and it is up to you to take them at face value but not superficial value.`

Let’s look at some more Spotify features, their value to customers, and additional value to Spotify:

- **What your friends are listening to** `—>` you discover new music & feel connected `—>` Spotify benefits from social validation of friends using the same product & improves the algorithmic people profiling.
- **Playlists by moods (happy, party, etc.)** `—>` you find music that suits how you feel right now `—>` Spotify knows better when to recommend you music with different characteristics, including in ads
- **Spotify Original playlists** `—>` you find music that has a high probability of resonating `—>` Spotify benefits from being the tastemakers and gatekeepers of the music industry

***You wouldn’t advertise any of the latter values to your customers;*** in fact, it would dilute the authenticity of what you are trying to sell.

When we look at the connection between features and value, **we learn that we should think and prioritize those that are a double-edged sword.**

These are the real killer features, ***because they are loved by the customer AND the company.***

`Too often companies think about features as a way to only improve the lead funnel and boost retention. Rather, features can equally be considered as ways to create novel value in creative or unknown ways.`

Spotify’s customers aren't just its listeners. *Those people consume huge amounts of data for a few dollars a month.*

Spotify’s customers are also its advertisers. ***And they love your favorite Spotify features more than you do.***

Crazy, huh?
