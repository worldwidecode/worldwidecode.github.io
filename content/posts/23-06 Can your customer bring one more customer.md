## Can your customer bring one more customer?

Word of mouth is the most potent form of marketing. **Its conversion rate can be up to 10 times higher than any other channel.**

There are varying levels of word of mouth, each with its own potential for leverage:

These are the **main** traits that can be combined for a customer involved in *word of mouth:*

1. **Champion:** Always mentions your company in any context.
2. **Advocate:** Mentions your company in specific conversations or for specific needs.
3. **Fan:** Likes your company and engages, but doesn't push.
4. **Benefactor:** *Directly **benefits*** from involving others with your company.
5. **Friend:** Feels a *social obligation* towards your company.

`Considering topics on a spectrum with different strengths is a useful approach. Although not strictly two-dimensional, adopting this perspective can deepen your understanding of common phrases like "word of mouth."`

This article primarily focuses on the ***Benefactor trait*** and how to create mutually beneficial deals with customers.

Most companies lack a referral program.

`Referral programs have gained the reputation of being associated with cheap products.`

When people know they're being promoted something through a referral, they become naturally skeptical.

Those being referred will ask themselves:

`"Does this truly benefit me, or just them?"`

Hence, we recognize the **challenge** of developing and branding the right referral program.

**It's a challenge.**

Let's dispense with any pretense.

**There's nothing inherently wrong with a referral program. There's nothing inherently wrong with *any* channel.**

In fact, capitalizing on untapped channels your competitors haven't exploited is an advantage! Marketing through an undersaturated channel is *much more likely* to grab peopleâ€™s attention.

Our equation has three components.

It has three parties that need to win (benefit):

`Referral program success = [1] Target lead success + [2] Our benefactor customer success + [3] Our company success`

For this equation to hold true, there's **one condition:**

`[1], [2], and [3] must each individually be > 0 (i.e., there must be a level of success for each of the parties).`

**Success doesn't solely hinge on direct financial or numerical gains.**

Consider these examples:

- Our benefactor recommended a fantastic product that our target lead liked. *Their bond grew stronger.*
- Our company collaborated with our benefactor. *We fostered a working relationship and gained a deeper mutual understanding of how to assist each other.*
- Our benefactor initiated a conversation between our company and the target lead. *We weren't the right fit, but we still offered advice to their company. They've become a friend.*

Take some time to outline the different facets of success your referral program could encompass.

**Referral programs aren't just about acquiring *more* customers. They offer our company another avenue to explore both known and unknown growth opportunities.**

Not every benefactor will manage to bring in one customer.

However, if the contract value is significant, you could consider offering them a financial incentive. *Just ensure your offer to them is well-done: financial measures like rebates or discounts won't always work or may not be **appropriate.***

**Some benefactors will be financially motivated, while others might be driven by status, or by simply wanting to support you.**

**Each of these scenarios demands a distinct approach.**

Consider crafting something personalized.

`What additional service can we offer our benefactors as a token of gratitude?`

Reflect on what they desire and require.

***To motivate them to put in genuine effort, you need to make them care* almost *as much as you do.***

Transparency is key. Keep them engaged and informed.

`What's one more customer worth to you?`
