## Bring in an authority until you have become one

*I’m writing this from the perspective of a website for simplicity, but the lessons apply to any form of communication in marketing or sales (paid ads, pitch decks…).*

When someone lands on your website, they automatically try to determine **if you're legitimate.**

There are various ways customers assess a company's legitimacy, most of which are **subconscious.**

Customers do this based on their experiences; they search for **familiar trademarks that their known companies *possess*,** at its foundation traits as correct grammar, clean design, and a common content structure.

However, many customers have also learned that anyone can hire a designer and writer. 

`It’s challenging to uncover the company `**`behind the scenes `** `of a polished website or deck.`

Especially with digital products and services, there’s often **a fear** of being *deceived.*

*"Why is this person offering data so cheaply? What secret do they possess that I can also discover?"*

**The most compelling incentive to engage with something, ultimately leading to a sale, is social validation.**

`Social validation is the fundamental societal premise that has enabled humans to come together, fostering the growth of economies and communities.`

If your customer senses that someone *they* **know**, either directly or indirectly, has engaged with your business or even made a purchase, they will feel a sense of ***familiarity.***

The feeling of **familiarity** is akin to a feeling of safety.

When making a purchasing decision with real money, most customers want to ensure that they’re making a **safe** choice.

`Most businesses don't make many spending decisions based on taking big risks, as their business itself is already one massive risk.`

**Social validation can equally originate from companies and organizations.**

If you're selling a marketing tool for *efficiency*, ideally you would **associate it** with a company known for having *a strong marketing team, a solid reputation, rapid growth…*

`Which logo companies would be beneficial to showcase on your website to inspire trust?`

It has become a trend in the startup world for smaller digital tools, for instance, to use phrases like *"**Used by** customers at Google, Apple, CNN"* instead of *“**Customers include** Google…”*

Reflect on this concept and approach it creatively.

*Can you identify a person or company that would be willing to publicly endorse you in your marketing materials?*

`A good marketing strategy lowers your customers' guarded barriers so they feel safe to spend money with you.`
