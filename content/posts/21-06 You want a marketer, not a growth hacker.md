## You want a marketer, not a growth hacker

It's intriguing to witness how the term *"growth hacking"* has taken over startups over the past few years.

Every emerging VC-backed company seems eager to secure one of these *infamous individuals.*

**The term *"hacking"* alone carries an air of excitement and potential**—implying the capability to *rocket launch* your company growth through shortcuts!

`Why wait for a marketer to take years, if a growth hacker can do it in months?`

After speaking to numerous individuals and assessing their hiring preferences, I have made a simple conclusion:

`What you actually want is a skilled, modern marketer who is good with software.`

To avoid any misinterpretation, allow me to quickly define some terms:

- **Marketing:** promoting the product or service you offer
- **Growth:** expanding the company's presence in a particular domain, often towards profitability
- **Growth marketing:** marketing that is tailored to scaling existing marketing operations
- **Growth hacking:** employing specialized techniques that lie *outside conventional marketing practices* to gain a competitive edge

Of course, getting everyone to agree on exact definitions is difficult.

`The life changing growth hack any growth hacker embarks upon is often in their own career: positioning themselves as a growth hacker rather than a marketer.`

While I previously identified as a growth hacker, my current stance is to simply state that *I possess the capability to growth hack or boast growth hacking skills.*

By this, I mean that my experiences have enabled me to: **1) identify gaps** within marketing processes, **2) capitalize** on existing internal resources, **3) conceive smart methods** for enhancing the lead journey and conversion rates.

**Growth hacking infers that the groundwork for marketing processes *has already been laid within a company.***

I always advocate for companies to establish a foundational level of marketing operations *prior* to expanding specific channels through new hires.

Thus, when people tell me that their early-stage company with a single marketer seeks a growth hacker, I wish they would free themselves from the false expectation that such unicorns exist.

A more precise term for what most companies are truly seeking is:

- Full stack marketer: an individual adept in all areas of marketing
- Technical marketer: an expert specializing in tools and software

CEOs, very few people will be able to find real shortcuts for you.

Should your aim be to ***market much better***, don’t just search for *“growth hackers”,* include all marketing titles, and search for someone who:

1. Has experience in your niche
2. Has experience with the channels you want to double down on
3. Has a genuine passion for what you’re doing - these people will figure it out *at all costs*
