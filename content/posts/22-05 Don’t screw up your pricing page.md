## Don’t screw up your pricing page

When customers land on your website, the first thing many of them do is **instantly click through to your pricing page.**

`Customers want to know if your offering falls within their expected spending range.`

**They have already *explicitly* or *implicitly* defined this.**

The method they use depends on factors like:

1. Their personality
2. Their authority in making spending decisions
3. Their relative role and departmental influence
4. Their past purchasing choices
5. Their experience with prices from competitors and similar tools
6. *…and so much more*

Ultimately, it boils down to a single high-level consideration:

**How much is the solution to their problem worth to *them* in *dollars*?**

*You won't come across a pricing page that states “$50 per month + 5 hours of installation time + 10 hours of configuration.”*

**Mistakes in presenting this number could instantly deter your customer.**

Various strategies can be employed here, ranging from the classic use of $.99 to encouraging customers to toggle between yearly and monthly options, thereby engaging with more content.

`Your customers’ eyes are scanning for a single value. Your job is to generate further interest if that  number alone doesn't get enough buy-in.`

They will be laser-focused on accomplishing this task. ***You have to distract them.***

`During the price-finding journey, their gaze should naturally catch hold of messaging that entices them to explore further.`

For instance, a captivating page headline, such as *“Used by senior developers at Microsoft.”*

***Gently prod them with intriguing ideas that compel them to finally answer.***

**You have only a few opportunities for this,** since a long and complex price search may confuse your customer and lead them to simply exit out the page.

`You must compose your web pages like a masterpiece: this is the art of marketing.`

A common error I observe on companies' pricing pages is advertising features that are ***basic and taken for granted.***

**Emphasize** only your strongest and most unique features; everything else takes a backseat.

`You don’t have unlimited time and attention. You **must** prioritize.`

Another factor to bear in mind, particularly if you offer digital products (software or subscriptions), is that you need to step outside of your own perspective and consider a customer who is unfamiliar with the functioning of what you offer.

Depending on your channel, your customer might have also recently visited the websites of your competitors.

They don’t comprehend what *“1000 actions”* with your tool entails. ***If they have to consult your FAQ to understand, they’ll already be frustrated.***

Similarly, they are unsure about the meaning of a *“retainer”* for your sales agency. **They want to know the hours per week they’ll receive.**

`The crucial questions your customers have circle back to the usability of your offering.`

If you can convince your customer that your product packs a ****dollar-for-dollar punch****, *you are marketing well.*

**Connect with a frame of reference they understand,** such as the number of hours saved or potential revenue generated.

`Every dollar your customer spends with you could be spent elsewhere with a comparable outcome in terms of their high-level objectives.`

***Think more about your homepage and pricing page than any other page on your website.***
