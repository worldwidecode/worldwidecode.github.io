## Do not overly intellectualize; return to the truth

You **must** start with the principles.

**A first principle is one of the foundational building blocks of something *that is true.***

For example, in physics, a first principle is ***the law*** of the conservation of energy, which cannot be created or destroyed but only transformed.

`When we attempt to apply first principles to marketing, we must return to the fundamental basics of how business operates, society functions, and how people think.`

A quote from Elon Musk:

*"Boil things down to the most fundamental truths and ask, 'OK, what are we sure is true, or as sure as possible is true?' And then reason up from there."*

It is quite difficult to agree upon a subset of first principles for marketing because ***it is not a scientific field with empirical truths.***

However, we can still employ *the same reasoning and logic* to try and deduce what the most basic things *probably* are.

***Going back to basics fights the* detached *over-intellectualization of marketing.***

I have seen many people entering the realm of marketing with little knowledge beyond some specific details, usually just about channels *("marketing involves using social media, email, and LinkedIn to sell products").*

The concept of channels is a subset of marketing, but it does not encompass **the philosophy** itself. 

Similar to studying the greats like Kant and Socrates, *we must start with the basics* and remind ourselves that **all other knowledge builds upon these basics.**

***Let's go through two first principles that I find important:***

`First principle: Your customers are spending money they worked hard for. They want a return that compensates for how hard they worked for it.`

Every dollar that exits your customer's pockets, whether they are an individual or a business, originates from a *lifetime's accumulation of effort to arrive there* **and** have *the capacity* to make that spending decision.

**Everyone desires to realize a return on their investment; this is how they evaluate whether something holds *great value or some value.***

`Remarkable offerings provide a big return on investment.`

This return can be financial, emotionally, nutritionally, in terms of status…

When you opt to sell something, you must place it *within the context of the individual who purchases it.*

If you are selling to a VP of Sales at a major corporation, you must consider how whatever you are selling will benefit not only their business, ***but also themselves.*** *How will this impact their future ROI in their work and, consequently, the job market?*

`First Principle: Money is merely a measure of value.`

One of the most significant errors that founders repeatedly commit is that they don’t price on value, rather some almost arbitrary measure or figure that somehow sounds *reasonable.*

*"A software tool shouldn't exceed $20 per month."*

This is completely *irrational.*

The most crucial step you can take is to **genuinely comprehend the value you provide** to your customers.

If you are not restricted to adhering to market prices, established due to saturation and awareness, you must make a value *calculation.*

*(You are always competing with the market, although sometimes implicitly.)*

When you are delivering ***human effort,*** it is quite straightforward:

`The price of human work = person or team's market value(experience * impact)`

However, for products, particularly digital ones, a simple approach is to envision that the solution you are presenting exists in ***human form.***

If your customer genuinely needed a problem resolved and could hire a *human* to complete that specific task on-demand, ***how much would they be willing AND able to pay that human (per month)?***

`I cannot emphasize enough the significance of the term “able”, as these are the financial constraints that completely bind your customer, regardless of their intentions.`

However, it is not about the final absolute figure derived from comprehending the human value of your work.

It is about understanding how *badly* your customer **desires** what you are offering.


***For instance, suppose you are marketing a social media tool for $x per month that generates content:***

- *The average customer is willing to pay $400 per month for the same result.*
- *The tool's content quality is 70% of what a human could produce.*
- *It consumes 4 hours of the customer's time per month, valued at $20 per hour.*
- *The customer seeks a 50% return on investment (ROI) with your tool.*

*The calculation, accounting for the time cost, is as follows:*

1. *The value of what the customer would pay a human: $400*
2. *The tool's content quality: 70% of $400 = $280*
3. *The time cost of using the tool: 4 hours * $20/hour = $80 (an expense)*
4. *Adjusted value of the tool to the customer: $280 (quality) - $80 (time cost) = $200*
5. *Desired ROI: 50%*

*Now, inputting the above figures:*

***Tool Price = Adjusted Value to Customer / (1 + Desired ROI) = $133.33***


Thus, the tool's price should be approximately **$133.33 per month** *factoring in the quality, time cost, and their desired return on investment.*

`This is a simplified model to aid in comprehending the mental process behind determining price and returning to fundamentals and first principles.`

In general, you would want to expand this to attain *as accurate an **estimate** as possible.*

Rather, performing mathematical calculations like this provides you **a *reference framework* for establishing your pricing.**

Contemplate what other first principles are relevant for marketing, your business, and the industry and niche in which you operate.

You will find that **thinking through these principles yields much greater value** than your typical *LinkedIn post on x arbitrary topic that excites you.*

`Think first principles. Only once you have accomplished that, move on to the second.`
