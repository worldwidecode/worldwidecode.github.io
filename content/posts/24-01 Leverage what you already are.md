## Leverage what you already are

Whether you're starting something new or working on an existing project, **always try to take advantage of your current skill set in every task.**

We often hear advice from so-called gurus about always operating in discomfort, claiming  where growth happens ***only there***. 

**I disagree; rather we should operate where we can.** 

This includes acknowledging that *we can often do more than we think.* Where we can't is often just a fear barrier we have the power to overcome.

`When deciding where to focus your efforts for maximum personal and business growth, first consider your risk propensity and ability.`

**Once you understand your risk profile, you can better assess how to *balance your workload.***

Let me explain using an equation (for visualization, not mathematical purposes):
`Your growth workload = (risk propensity * relative output of the percentage of time spent on work you feel comfortable doing) / (risk propensity * relative output of the percentage of time spent on work you feel uncomfortable doing)`

**People don't operate in extremes; we must find *balance.***

*I propose a good rule for most working people is 80/20: spend 80% of your time doing what you're good at and the remaining 20% in the discomfort zone.*

Extract lessons from the latter, imagining it exists on the periphery of the former, and gain novel ideas to improve your common workload. ***Variety is the spice of life.***

**If you're a risk-taker, you might adopt a profile like 60/40.** *I believe this is where most entrepreneurs are* when they make the leap to starting a business or project of their own. It's worth noting that I am *not* differentiating between hard skills, soft skills, or related mental aspects like experience, intuition, memory, or intelligence.

Doing what you're good at might mean working in an unknown industry (40%) but with confidence in your people skills (60%). Quantifying this is challenging because it's situation-specific. ***Hence, logic precedes numbers.***

`By leveraging who you are, what you have, know, and can already do; you ensure that you work in a space where you feel good about yourself. That is growth.` 

I would argue: *don't chase discomfort; simply follow your natural and desired risk profile.* To do just that, you'll need to engage in some *self-reflection.*

And, of course, ask: **who do I want to become?**
