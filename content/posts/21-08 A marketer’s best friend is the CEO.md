## A marketer’s best friend is the CEO

Marketing revolves around showcasing the true value a company possesses.

The value of your company can't be conveyed solely through the product or service offering and its *features*. ***It goes much deeper.***

`The value of what you sell hinges on the idea you present.`

Many products, especially in the startup arena, implicitly or explicitly promise a *better future* for the customer.

When a friend from school sells you a t-shirt from their new brand, you're buying into the promise that the brand will eventually thrive. *You're investing in the future.*

When a new LinkedIn automation tool offers you a yearly subscription, you’re buying into the upcoming features they're excited to introduce. *You're investing in the future.*

When the sales agency your friend referred you to arranges a call, you’re buying into the excitement of more sales. *You're investing in the future.*

`As a marketer, your role should include promoting not only the present but also the future.`

This is a surefire way to get people excited.

**People want to be part of a journey.** That's why when a new social app emerges, users rush to sign up, hoping to be among the first and to enjoy the potential follower growth ***and*** bragging rights.

`When you make a purchase, an element of the unknown adds intrigue.`

This resembles the dating scene, where individuals wrap themselves in mystery within their Tinder profiles.

Certainly, you can't make promises that will *never* materialize. **That's *fraud.***

Yet, enticing people to buy into a future vision of a company as a supplementary reason, or an additional value for their existing interest, ***might just tip the scale.***

`"We're planning to launch a mobile app too. It's an ambitious endeavor requiring more resources, but with the current trajectory, we're confident. We seek buy-in from valued customers like you."`

No one can predict the future.

But the future doesn’t just come - *it is created.*

**The individual with the clearest future vision within a company is the CEO,** or the founding team. At the very least, they end up guiding the company into a future direction.

**If you genuinely desire to craft a compelling story for your company, the CEO should *closely* collaborate with whoever leads marketing.**

The CEO should constantly articulate the company's mission and vision.

And in turn, **marketing should advise the CEO on how they can *together promote that vision for and with customers.*** Certainly, with insights from sales.

Every story unfolds over time.

**Construct a timeline outlining the *future* you can sell in the short-, medium-, and long-term.**

Stories can happen by accident.

But no one one ends up reading them *by accident.*

Only sometimes. *By accident.*
